When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?
  One tool that I have used in the past is repetition. Whether its notes or flash cards I need to see the information to really absorb it. Currently I have adapted this by using two separate note books containing class notes in one, and javascript information/notes in another. I find it's important to hand write information in my own words to make sure I understand and am not just repeating information I don't really grasp. This system shows where there are gaps in my understanding so I can research and talk to fellow students about what information is stumping me. From notes I make flash cards on keywords or key subjects and look through them at least once a day.  


As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?
  One of my strengths is I am organized. I know this because it was vital when I was a restaurant general manager. I was able handle multiple projects, schedules and goals all at the same time. Staying on top of what is coming in the future is just as important as what is happening today. I tend to be organized in every aspect of my life from my closet, to the files I keep, to my schedule within my personal life. Being organized is one way that I can try and control what little I have control over during classes, the pandemic and changing social landscape of 2020.   

Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):
  The best working condition for is alone but in the same proximity as another person or small group I can bounce ideas off of. I prefer to have silence so I can talk out-loud to myself, but if there is other noise I like to listen to music without words to stay focused. Having a notebook or pen and paper is also important so I can write down notes or other important information I might want to recall later. Also having clear expectations is extremely important to me so I know what is expected from me and my work.

As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?
  I believe this question means what area needs improvement when it comes to your professional skills. If I am correct in my thinking then my networking skills need improvement. I am not great at talking to new people and making networking connections. I understand why this is vital in a professional career but I am an introvert. Being in the tech industry I feel there are more personalities similar to mine that I will connect with. I am very excited to get involved in the community at Turning and get to have that professional network. Previously as I sales rep my interaction with networking was being crammed into a hotel ballroom monthly with 300 extroverted sales people, who just wanted to talk about themselves. So far speaking with people in my mod 0 class I can already see the difference and makes me hopeful for my networking skills.

How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?
   Developing a deeper understanding of my analytical personality traits will be benefit me when it comes to discovering how to write a piece of code or to solve a problem I encounter. Writing pseudocode is one area my logical thinking will likely come in handy when working with non-tech coworkers. Working along side one person or even a small group to bounce ideas off of will benefit my creative side to see problems from another perspective. This will not only challenge my view but also give more depth to my work.

Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:
  After Turing I would like to try get a job outside of Colorado. I would like to work for a company that has values and morals that also align with mine long term. Although I understand that this would be a first job in this career path so a short term job assignment with a company I'm not super in love with is perfectly acceptable. It will really be about gaining experience and learning the little niches that are part of this career.
