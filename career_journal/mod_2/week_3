1.Assess your habits from week 2: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen? 
  I spent a lot of my time reteaching and rereading my notes. 
2.Reflect on how you’ve spent your time so far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy: 

When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work? When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy? When do you feel energized in your work? When is your energy drained?
  1.Setting up habits and routines to make time for the job search this module:
    -Block out time on your calendar this week to work on your job search. When will you make this happen? How will you hold yourself accountable to this? What activities will you focus on during this time this week? What outcomes do you hope to reach by the end of this week because of these activities?
      -I will concentrate on setting up Hunter and understand its full capabilities. 
      -Next week I will block out time time to look at my Hunter board and reflect on how to last week went and what has changed from one week to the next. 
      
  2.Applying wayfinding to using job search resources
    -Go through the resources listed here and explore 2-3 tools. List what you looked at here: 
      -I looked at GlassDoor, Key Values and Career Bliss.
      
    -Apply wayfinding: of what you looked at, what did you discover that aligns with your vision? If it didn’t align with your vision, what will you try next? Decide what tools to bookmark to explore later. 
      -I have bookmarked the Muse and Startupers.
      -I have never heard of either and will explore them later. 
      
    -Find a job posting that aligns with your vision. What’s the posting? How does it align with what you’re looking for? Add it to your Huntr. 
      -I found the Boeing is currently hiring JR devs which I would love to work at. I will follow up by look at others in this same position and seeing what is required for this position. 
      -I also found a Jr dev job for an energy company which I would love to work in green energy but the glass door review on this compnay is pretty terrible so I will not follow up after researching the company more. 
      
    -What next steps will you take to explore that opportunity and find contacts? Add that information to your Huntr card.
      -I will use LinkdIn to try and see others that hold these positions.
